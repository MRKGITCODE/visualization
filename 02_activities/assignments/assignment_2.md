# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      Here's an explanation and breakdown of what a "Good" Visualization is based on your reference:

A "Good" Example of Visualization

Source: Environment Bureau, Census and Statistics Department, Electrical and Mechanical Services Department, EEE Power and Energy Magazine
Description
The visualization provides a detailed breakdown of the electricity grid in Hong Kong, illustrating the sources of electricity, the distribution among different sectors, and major electricity users. It uses a Sankey diagram format to depict the flow of electricity from generation and import to consumption and loss.
The primary purpose of any good visualization is to communicate data effectively. Whether it's to compare, analyze trends, or present a geographical relationship, the visualization must have a defined purpose and convey this message clearly to the audience.
Example: In a power grid visualization, the purpose could be to showcase the distribution of power, identify key nodes in the system, or highlight areas with potential issues.
Accurate Representation of Data:

A good visualization represents data truthfully. It should not exaggerate or downplay any insights the data offers. It should be honest in its presentation, avoiding misleading axes or proportions.
Example: A power grid visualization might show the electrical grid's efficiency or highlight areas with power shortages without distortion.
Engaging and Intuitive Design:

The design should be visually appealing, with a clean and organized layout. The use of colors, fonts, and shapes should be cohesive and make it easy for the audience to engage with the information presented.
Example: In a complex data-heavy subject like power grids, using color coding to represent energy flow or outages can make the visualization both attractive and informative. For instance, red could indicate areas with power failures, while green indicates optimal functioning areas.
Interactivity:

Good visualizations often incorporate interactivity, allowing users to explore the data themselves. This can be through hover-over effects, filtering, zooming, or clickable sections.
Example: In a dynamic power grid visualization, users could click on different regions to view real-time data, historical trends, or performance metrics specific to that area.
Well-Defined Data Sources:

The source of the data should always be clear. Good visualizations cite the data providers and ensure that the data comes from reliable, valid sources. Transparency builds trust with the audience.
Example: The "Power Grid" visualization you are referring to cites various government departments and energy publications, ensuring that the data is credible.
Appropriate Use of Tools and Techniques:

Effective visualizations utilize the best tools for the jobâ€”whether it's bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, or geographic maps. Choosing the right visualization technique helps to tell the data story effectively.
Example: A geographical map or flow diagram would work well for a power grid visualization, helping users understand the locations and flow of energy in the network.
A "Bad" Example of Visualization

Name: An unprecedented death toll in Qatar
Source: Washington Post
Description

The data visualization presents a comparison of worker deaths associated with major sporting events in various countries, highlighting the number of migrant worker deaths in Qatar since December 2010.
Pros

Focus on a Serious Issue: The visualization aims to present a serious issue by bringing attention to the significant number of worker deaths in Qatar compared to other locations. Simple and Consistent Icons: It uses simple and consistent icons to represent deaths, making it easy to understand at a glance.
Cons

Time Frame: While it states that the data for Qatar covers migrant worker deaths "since December 2010," it does not specify an end date. This omission leaves the viewer uncertain about the period over which these deaths were counted, making it difficult to interpret the data accurately or compare it with other events. As Edward Tufte emphasizes in "The Visual Display of Quantitative Information," clarity and detailed context are essential for accurate data interpretation.

Sector and Scope: The visualization lacks clarity regarding the sectors or types of work included in the death counts for each country. For example, it does not specify whether the reported deaths were related to the construction of sports facilities, infrastructure, or other associated projects.

From the examples of other countries, it appears that the data focuses on worker deaths occurring in connection with major sporting events, such as the Olympics or World Cup. However, the section on Qatar does not provide similar specificity. It is unclear whether the deaths are linked to preparations for a specific event, or if they encompass a broader range of projects and sectors. Moreover, there is no indication of the specific period during which these deaths were recorded, making it difficult to understand the scope and context of the data presented.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved? 
Suggested Improvements for "good" example
Visual Complexity:

The visualization contains a lot of information, which can overwhelm viewers. Simplifying the design by breaking down the data into multiple, smaller charts or focusing on key aspects in separate visualizations could make it easier to digest. For example, separate diagrams could highlight electricity sources, consumption sectors, and major consumers individually.
User Interaction and Accessibility:

The visualization is static, lacking interactive elements that could enhance user engagement and accessibility. For instance, adding interactive features like hover-over tooltips with additional information or clickable elements to expand on specific data points could make the visualization more user-friendly.
Suggested Improvements for "bad" example
Clarify Time Frame:

The visualization should specify the exact time period over which the data for Qatar and other countries were collected. For Qatar, it should clearly indicate the end date for the data on migrant worker deaths, in addition to the start date of December 2010. This clarity would help viewers understand the duration over which these deaths occurred and allow for more accurate comparisons.
Detail the Sector and Scope:

The visualization should clearly state the sectors or types of work included in the death counts. For other countries, it seems to focus on worker deaths related to the construction and preparation for major sporting events. It should confirm whether this focus is consistent across all countries and provide specifics for Qatar. For Qatar, it should clarify whether the data pertains to the construction of sports facilities, infrastructure projects, or other types of work. Additionally, it should specify if these deaths are associated with a particular event, such as the FIFA World Cup 2022, or cover a broader range of projects and periods.
Use a Clear Scale and Labels:

The visualization would benefit from adding numerical labels or a clear legend to indicate the exact number of worker deaths. This would prevent any confusion or misinterpretation caused by relying solely on icons to represent the data. A precise visual scale can help viewers grasp the magnitude of the differences between countries more accurately.
Provide Comparative Context:
To offer a more balanced perspective, the visualization should include additional context, such as the total number of workers involved in each country, the scale and complexity of the projects, and any relevant working conditions or safety regulations. This context is crucial for understanding why there might be significant differences in worker deaths between countries. It could also address factors like labor practices, enforcement of safety standards, and environmental conditions that may impact worker safety.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
